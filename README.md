# Youtube_Summariser-Langchain-OpenAI

A walk-through guide on how to use Langchain & OpenAI to QA & summarise YouTube videos.

The YouTube Summariser project combines OpenAI and LangChain's capabilities to provide valuable insights and practical guidance.
We have created a tool that revolutionises our engagement with YouTube videos by leveraging these cutting-edge technologies.
With the YouTube Summariser, users can access concise summaries of YouTube videos to grasp key points and take meaningful action quickly.

This project simplifies extracting vital information from lengthy videos, saving users valuable time and effort.
Whether you're an entrepreneur or a researcher, the YouTube Summariser offers a convenient solution for accessing insightful takeaways. It condenses video content into easily digestible summaries, allowing you to grasp the main points without watching the entire video.

I have set up the jupyter notebook as a walk-through guide. Even if you are a beginner, you should be able to understand the key concepts. My goal is for you to be able to apply this to your own use cases.

**The project is split into two. **

1.	The YouTube QA tool - a simple QA tool where you can ask any YouTube video questions based on its contents
2.	The YouTube custom prompt tool - build a ChatGPT-like prompt to extract specific information you need and structure it in your desired format.
